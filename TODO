remove transformer call stacks?
can slice be read in before pass-off to arch-general display funcs?
complex and float type missing... but who cares for now? float probably easier to implement...
prevent crashy vma copy by halting memcpy() at brk() limit?
* collapsing is broken
* remove worthless libelf dependency
* collapse duplicate bytes in string or slice view


Major updates needed:
	1. Function hooking should use allocated jmpbufs instead of replace-and-single-step
