remove transformer call stacks?
can slice be read in before pass-off to arch-general display funcs?
* getenv() is now broken in injected module code
complex type missing... but who cares for now?
get floats working quickly?
prevent crashy vma copy by halting memcpy() at brk() limit?
* collapsing is broken
* use proper bounds checking in parsing ELF virtual addresses for PCDATA lookup


Major updates needed:
	1. Function hooking should use allocated jmpbufs instead of replace-and-single-step
	2. Get cgo calling working again
		*a. try increasing stack size
		b. Try setting _cgo_sys_thread_create_addr = NULL
