remove transformer call stacks?
* analysis of clone call should not occur in dump_wait_state() function
can slice be read in before pass-off to arch-general display funcs?
getenv() is now broken in injected module code
* get floats working quickly?
* get rid of XMALLOC/XSTRDUP*


Major updates needed:
	1. Get cgo calling working again
	2. Function hooking should use allocated jmpbufs instead of replace-and-single-step
