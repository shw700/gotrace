remove transformer call stacks?
can slice be read in before pass-off to arch-general display funcs?
* getenv() is now broken in injected module code
complex type missing... but who cares for now?
get floats working quickly?
prevent crashy vma copy by halting memcpy() at brk() limit?
* collapsing is broken


Major updates needed:
	1. Get cgo calling working again
	2. Function hooking should use allocated jmpbufs instead of replace-and-single-step
	3. PCData integration
